    Consistent communication is key to a cohesive team. Proper workload decomposition paired with communication allows a team to successfully break apart a difficult project into smaller solvable pieces in the small time frame. Proper planning allows a team to overcome tribulations and challenges that are sure to come up over the course of development. Finally, we should be willing to utilize the resources we have from our professors, mentors, and sponsors. & We believe that in order to be successful we should avoid certain major pitfalls that could lead to the downfall of our project. Being inconsistent with communication would be the first of these issues, without good communication a team can completely fall apart in a very short period of time. In the same vein as a failure to communicate, a failure to be proactive in decision making, and a lack of Decisiveness which we believe to be a core team value could be very detrimental.

    Positive impact behaviors tie back into the keys to success, Communication is one of the most important positive behaviors a team can have and is crucial for success. Planning is also crucial in order to avoid confusion. To be a functional team it's important to have a growth-focused mindset in order to grow our knowledge and change for the better as well as be kind and understanding to our fellow team members. & The lack of communication in a team can quickly snowball into a larger issue. Understanding that as individuals we can heavily impact other team members is vital to our success.
